## Introduction

- A Bit of History

  >The Java® programming language is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented language. It was designed to support multiple host architectures and to allow secure delivery of software components.  
  >
  >Programmers can write a program once, and it will run on any machine supplying a Java run-time environment. 

- The Java Virtual Machine

  > Like a real computing machine, it has an instruction set and manipulates various memory areas at run time
  >
  > For the sake of security, the Java Virtual Machine imposes strong syntactic and structural constraints on the code in a `class` file 
  >
  > any language with functionality that can be expressed in terms of a valid `class` file can be hosted by the Java Virtual Machine.  
  >
  >machine-independent platform, implementors of other languages can turn to the Java Virtual Machine as a delivery vehicle for their languages.
